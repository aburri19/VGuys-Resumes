        <h2>PROJECTS</h2>
    <h3>Capstone Group Project - Maritime Vessel Detection Using a Network of Marine Radars via a Simulation in Unity</h3>
        <p> We developed a maritime vessel detection system using a network of marine radars simulated in Unity to enhance maritime surveillance in the UAE. The project addressed traditional radar limitations by integrating deep learning with buoy-mounted radars, enabling unmanned, real-time maritime situational awareness. A scalable and cost-effective solution was designed to train and test vessel detection capabilities in a simulated environment. The system demonstrated high detection accuracy, achieving an F1-score of 0.938 using the CenterNet deep learning model.</p>
        <h3>IoT Home Automation System</h3>
        <p> Designed and implemented a smart home security system integrating IoT, RFID authentication, and sensor-based automation for enhanced safety. Features included secure access control, real-time surveillance, environmental monitoring, and automated lighting. The system provided remote monitoring via the ThingSpeak IoT platform and a buzzer alarm for intrusion detection, ensuring a multi-layered security approach.</p>
        <h3>LC3 Machine Code Decoder</h3>
        <p> Developed a C++ program to translate hexadecimal LC-3 machine code into human-readable instructions. The program decodes each instruction step-by-step, extracting opcodes and operands, then converting them into corresponding LC-3 assembly language. This implementation provides a straightforward method to interpret LC-3 assembly instructions from their hexadecimal representation, aiding in program analysis and debugging.</p>
